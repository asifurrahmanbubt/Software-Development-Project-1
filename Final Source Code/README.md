#### This is our final source code for the Software Development Project-1 Course

This GitHub repository contains a C program that implements a task management system for a specific month. The program allows users to add, modify, and delete tasks for each day of the month. It also provides features for viewing tasks, searching for tasks by description, saving tasks to a file, and loading tasks from a file.

The program prompts the user to enter the year and month for which they want to manage tasks. It then displays a calendar for the specified month and allows the user to add tasks to specific days. The user can also modify or delete existing tasks, view tasks for a particular day, search for tasks by description, and change the date of a task.

Additionally, the program offers options to save the tasks to a file and load tasks from a file, allowing users to persist their task data across multiple program executions.

To use the program, simply compile and run the provided C code. The program will guide the user through the task management process, displaying relevant prompts and menus for each operation.

Please note that this code is provided as-is and may require additional modifications or error handling for production use.

We have successfully tested and run the program.
